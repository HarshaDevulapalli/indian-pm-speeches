President Almazbek Atambaev,Members of the media,It is a great pleasure to visit this beautiful country.

Kyrgystan and India are also united by the bonds of shared democratic values.We see an important place for Central Asia in India’s future. We can reinforce each other’s economic progress. Sustainable development is important for both. We can contribute to cooperation and integration across the different regions of Asia. We both seek a peaceful and secure neigbourhood at a time of challenges in our region. And, we have shared interest in combating extremism and terrorism that has become a threat without borders.My visit to all five countries in the region demonstrates the importance that we attach to a new level of relationship with Central Asia. Kyrgystan is a key part of that vision.I was pleased to meet President Atambaev. His contribution to democracy and development is admirable.I am delighted that our Election Commissions have signed an agreement on cooperation.
