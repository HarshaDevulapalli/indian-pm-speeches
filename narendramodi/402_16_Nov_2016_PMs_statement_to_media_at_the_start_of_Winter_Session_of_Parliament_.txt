Namaskar to all of you. The winter session of parliament gets underway today. Last session was a witness to a major decision on GST and the parliament made a major contribution towards realizing the dream of One nation, one tax. I thanked all the parties on that day. When all parties work together in the larger nation interest, positive outcomes and results emerge. I hope this session will also see a healthy debate on various issues as it sets the stage for very good decisions..Of course, parties would present their views. We will talk about the issues pertaining to the needs and the aspirations of the people. Besides, the governmentâ€™s thinking would also be reflected. I expect a good, healthy debate with excellent contribution from all the political parties.. From the Government side, we will strive our level best to accomplish the transaction of business carrying all the political parties together. In order to carry forward the work on GST, we have held discussions with the state Government and the political parties. The consultation process has been going on ahead of this session as well.
