It is my particular pleasure to welcome Excellency the Prime Minister of Portugal, the Vice President of Suriname, the honourable Ministers from Malaysia and Mauritius to the event.Their achievements, the name they have earned in their own societies and globally, are a great inspiration for all of us.
It also reflects the success, glory and enterprise of Indian diaspora the world over.There are over 30 million Overseas Indians living abroad. Their footprint is all over the world. But, Indians abroad are valued not just for their strength in numbers. They are respected for the contributions they make – to India and to the societies and countries where they live in foreign lands and communities across the globe, irrespective of the path they take, and the goals they pursue, the Indian diaspora represents the best of Indian culture, ethos and values. Their hard-work, discipline, law-abiding and peace loving nature are role models for other immigrant communities abroad.à¤à¤ª à¤à¥ à¤ªà¥à¤°à¥à¤°à¤£à¤¾ à¤à¤, à¤à¤¦à¥à¤¦à¥à¤¶à¥à¤¯ à¤à¤¨à¥à¤, à¤®à¤¾à¤°à¥à¤ à¤µà¤¿à¤­à¤¿à¤¨à¥à¤¨, à¤®à¤à¤à¤¿à¤²à¥à¤ à¤¤à¤®à¤¾à¤® à¤²à¥à¤à¤¿à¤¨ à¤­à¤¾à¤µ à¤à¤ -à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯à¤¤à¤¾à¥¤ à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤µà¤¾à¤¸à¥ à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯ à¤à¤¹à¤¾à¤ à¤°à¤¹à¥ à¤à¤¸à¥ à¤à¤°à¥à¤®à¤­à¥à¤®à¤¿ à¤®à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾,à¤à¤¹à¤¾à¤ à¤¸à¥ à¤à¤ à¤à¤¸à¥ à¤®à¤°à¥à¤®à¤­à¥à¤®à¤¿ à¤®à¤¾à¤¨à¤¾à¥¤  à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤µà¤¾à¤¸à¥ à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯ à¤à¤¹à¤¾à¤ à¤°à¤¹à¥ à¤µà¤¹à¤¾à¤ à¤à¤¾ à¤µà¤¿à¤à¤¾à¤¸ à¤à¤¿à¤¯à¤¾ à¤à¤° à¤à¤¹à¤¾à¤ à¤à¥ à¤¹à¥à¤ à¤µà¤¹à¤¾à¤ à¤­à¥ à¤à¤¸à¥à¤® à¤¯à¥à¤à¤¦à¤¾à¤¨ à¤à¤¿à¤¯à¤¾à¥¤ Friends, For my government and for me personally, engagement with the overseas Indian community  has been a key area of priority.  I have met and spoken to hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters during my travels abroad â in USA, UK, Australia, South Africa, UAE, Qatar, Singapore, Fiji, China, Japan, South Korea, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, Malaysia and other countries. As a result of our sustained and systematic out-reach, there is new energy, keen desire and strong drive among Indian Diaspora to connect more extensively and deeply with Indiaâs social and economic transformation
The remittance of close to sixty nine billion dollars annually by the overseas Indians makes an invaluable contribution/ to the Indian economy.à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤µà¤¾à¤¸à¥ à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯à¥à¤ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤¦à¥à¤¶ à¤à¥ à¤µà¤¿à¤à¤¾à¤¸ à¤à¥ à¤²à¤¿à¤ à¤à¤¦à¤®à¥à¤¯ à¤à¤à¥à¤à¤¾à¤¶à¤à¥à¤¤à¤¿ à¤¹à¥; à¤µà¥ à¤¦à¥à¤¶ à¤à¥ à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤à¤¤à¤¿ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¤ à¤¸à¥à¤à¥à¤à¤¹à¥à¤²à¥à¤¡à¤° à¤¹à¥ à¤¹à¤®à¤¾à¤°à¥ à¤µà¤¿à¤à¤¾à¤¸ à¤¯à¤¾à¤¤à¥à¤°à¤¾ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¤ª à¤¹à¤®à¤¾à¤°à¥ à¤à¤ VALUABLE PARTNER à¤¹à¥à¤à¥¤ à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤ à¤à¥ BRAIN DRAIN à¤à¥ BRAIN GAIN à¤®à¥à¤ à¤¬à¤¦à¤²à¤¨à¥ à¤à¥ à¤¹à¤®à¤¾à¤°à¥ à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¯à¤¾à¤¸à¥à¤ à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¤ª à¤¸à¤¹à¤­à¤¾à¤à¥ à¤¹à¥à¥¤ NRIs and PIOs have made outstanding contributions to their chosen fields.
Among them, there are politicians of stature, scientists of repute, outstanding doctors, brilliant educationists, economists, musicians, famous philanthropists, journalists, bankers, engineers and lawyers. And, sorry, did I mention our well known Information Technology professionals? Tomorrow, 30 overseas Indians will receive from the President, the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards, which recognize contributions made by them in various fields, both in India and abroad.Friends, Irrespective of their background and profession, the welfare and safety of all Indians abroad is our top priority. For this, we are strengthening the entire eco-system of our administrative arrangements. Whether it is on loss of their passports, need for legal advice, medical assistance, shelter, or even transportation of mortal remains to India, I have directed all Indian embassies to be proactive to address problems of Indian nationals abroad.Our response to the needs of the Indian nationals overseas is defined by Accessibility, sensitivity, speed and promptness. 24 by 7 help-lines by Indian Embassies; âOpen Houseâ meetings with Indian nationals; consular camps; twitter seva for passport services; and use of social media platforms for immediate access; are some of the measures that we have put in place  to convey a clear message  that we are there for you when you need us.The security of Indian nationals abroad is of utmost importance to us. In situations of distress faced by Indian nationals, we have reached out to ensure their safety, rescue and repatriation. Our External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj ji, has particularly been proactive and prompt in reaching out to distressed Indians abroad using social media. Under Operation à¤¸à¤à¤à¤ à¤®à¥à¤à¤¨ in July 2016, we evacuated over one hundred and fifty Indian nationals from South Sudan within 48 hours.  Prior to that, we evacuated several thousands of our citizens from conflict situations in Yemen in well-coordinated, smooth and swift operations. In the last two years – 2014-2016, we facilitated the repatriation of over ninety thousand Indian nationals from nearly 54 countries. Through the Indian Community Welfare Fund we have assisted more than eighty thousand Indian nationals abroad/ who were in contingency situations. Our aim is that for every Indian abroad, home should never be far away. For those workers who seek economic opportunities abroad, our effort is to provide maximum facilitation and ensure least inconvenience. Our motto is: “à¤¸à¥à¤°à¤à¥à¤·à¤¿à¤¤ à¤à¤¾à¤à¤, à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¶à¤¿à¤à¥à¤·à¤¿à¤¤ à¤à¤¾à¤à¤â. For this, we have streamlined our systems and taken several measures to safeguard emigration of Indian workers. About six lakh emigrants have been granted Emigration Clearance online for overseas employment through registered recruitment agents.  Online registration of foreign employers on e-Migrate portal has been made mandatory.
And, the grievances, complaints and petitions of the Indian migrant workers continue to be addressed online through e-Migrate and MADAD platforms. We are also taking strict action against illegal recruitment agents in India. Prosecution sanctions by CBI or State Police against illegal agents; and increase in the amount of Bank Guarantee deposited by the recruiting agents from Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.50 lakhs; are some of the steps in this direction. To ensure that the migrating Indian workers enjoy better economic opportunities, we will shortly launch a skill development program – the Pravasi Kaushal Vikas Yojana targeted at Indian youth who seek overseas employment.Friends. We have a special bond with the Indian Diaspora which is living in the Girmitiya  countries â who are deeply and emotionally attached with their place of origin. We are aware of difficulties faced by Persons of Indian Origin from these countries in obtaining an OCI Card if they moved abroad four or five generations ago. We acknowledge their concerns and have made efforts to address these issues.I am glad to announce that starting with Mauritius, we are working to put in place new procedures and documentation requirements so that the descendants of Girmitiyas from this country could become eligible for OCI Cards. We remain committed to addressing similar difficulties of PIOs in Fiji, Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and other Caribbean States.Like my request at the last Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, I would again encourage all PIO Card holders to convert their PIO Cards to OCI Cards. à¤®à¥à¤à¥ à¤ªà¤¤à¤¾ à¤¹à¥, à¤à¤¿ à¤à¤ª à¤à¤¾à¤«à¥ à¤µà¥à¤¯à¤¸à¥à¤¤ à¤°à¤¹à¤¤à¥ à¤¹à¥.à¤à¤¸à¥ à¤à¥ à¤¦à¥à¤à¤¤à¥ à¤¹à¥à¤,I am happy to announce  that we have extended the deadline for such conversion  from 31 December 2016, until June 30, 2017 without any penalty. From first of January this year, beginning with airports in Delhi and Bengaluru, we have also set up special counters at immigration points in our airports for OCI Card holders.

I am very happy to know that 160 of these young over-seas Indians are here today to participate in the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. A special welcome to the young Pravasisâ I hope that on returning to your respective countries, you will remain connected with us, wherever you are, and visit India again. Last year, the first edition of the online quiz  for young overseas Indians called âBharat ko Jaanoâ saw participation of more than 5000 young NRIs and PIOs.
