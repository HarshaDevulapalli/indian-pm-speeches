Excellency, I am in agreement what you just said about the strengths and future potential of our relationship.Friends,The Eastern coast of Africa, and Tanzania in particular have enjoyed strong links with the India. We are old maritime neighbours. Together, our leaders and our people have fought colonialism and racial oppression.Our merchants have traded since early nineteenth century. And, the vast stretch of Indian Ocean has kept our societies and our people connected.Friends,I am deeply grateful to President Magufuli for agreeing to my visit on a Sunday. It is a tribute to his motto of “Hapa kazi tu”, meaning-here work only.President Magufuli has a vision for nation building, development and industrialization – a vision that is my dream for India too.Friends,India is already a substantial economic partner of Tanzania. The whole range of our economic ties are healthy and on upswing.• Our two way annual trade stands at around US$ 3 billion;• Indian investments in Tanzania already total around US$ 3 billion; and• Indian businesses in Tanzania continue to grow and expand.We consider it our privilege to be a trusted partner in meeting Tanzania’s development priorities.Today, President Magufuli and I held detailed discussions on the full spectrum of our partnership.Our focus was to shape an action oriented agenda of cooperation, so that we talk less of potential and more of achievements on the ground.We agreed that our common desire of economic prosperity for our societies is creating new opportunities for expanding our cooperation.For this, both of us felt that we need to:• One, deepen our partnership in agriculture and food security, including through enhanced export of pulses from Tanzania to India;• Two, work together in development and use of natural gas;• Three, partner in building of industrial economy, capacities and institutions in Tanzania.and• Four, deepen our trade and investment partnership by encouraging greater industry to industry ties.Friends,As a developing country, India understands the need and urgency to improve the lives of our people.And, as a friend, what you want to achieve for your people would also be the focus of our efforts.In this regard, the completion of 100 million dollar water supply augmentation project for Dar es Salaam is a good achievement.We have just now also signed an agreement on water supply project in Zanzibar for a line of credit of $92 million. We are also working on a number of other water projects for 17 cities. And for this India is willing to consider an additional $500 million line of concessional credit Public Health is another important area of our engagement.We are ready to meet the healthcare priorities of the Tanzanian government, including of supply of medicines and equipment. I am told that an Indian radio-therapy machine is being installed at Bugando medical centre to treat cancer patients.Education, vocational training and skill development are other areas of your priority and where India is willing to offer all possible assistance.I also understand that the IT Resource Centre at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science & Technology, Arusha is close to completion.India’s cooperation with Tanzania will always be as per your needs and priorities.Friends,Being neighbours across Indian Ocean, President and I agreed to deepen our overall defence and security partnership, especially in the maritime domain.Our in-depth discussions on regional and global issues reflected our considerable convergence on issues of common interest and concern.We agreed to work closely, bilaterally, regionally and globally, to combat the twin threats of terrorism and climate change.On climate change, India had led the efforts to form an International Solar Alliance at COP 21 in Paris. In this Alliance, which has the support of over 120 countries, we welcome Tanzania as a crucial partner.Friends,We in India have had the honour to receive every President of Tanzania.
