"I am delighted to associate myself today with the launch of the Maha Suraksha Yojana, a unique social initiative of the Mahanagar Gas Limited. This social initiative, which provides personal accident insurance cover to all taxi and autorikshaw drivers using CNG vehicles, is a unique experiment in corporate social responsibility, pioneered in this great city of Mumbai.             Mumbai is not only the commercial capital of India but also one of the great cities of this world. I have a particular attachment with this city as I have lived here as the Governor of the Reserve bank of India. Whenever I have visited this great city, I have been amazed by the energy and life that drives the people of the city. The work culture of the city, the orderly systematic approach to day to day issues, the time consciousness of the people and calm and industriousness of its citizens are the envy of the rest of the country. And the success of this city has been based on the hard work and effort of its millions of residents among whom the drivers of taxis and autorikshaws form an essential component. Cities of this size can function only if there are efficient transport systems. While the suburban railway system in Mumbai takes care of a large portion of the transport needs of this city, private taxis and autorikshaws are equally important contributors to its smooth functioning. I have seen that even in times of crises - such as after the heavy rainfall last year - taxi and autorikshaw drivers calmly go about taking passengers from place to place, keeping the wheels of commerce and business functioning smoothly. And of course, we keep hearing stories of the honest drivers who return the purses and baggage forgotten by forgetful passengers!I think that the Mahanagar Gas company is doing a noble deed by starting this innovative insurance scheme for drivers of taxis and autorikshaws. By providing a one lakh rupee accident or permanent disability cover to CNG drivers, it is providing a social safety net to the vulnerable families of the drivers. Benefiting over 2 lakh drivers, I am sure that drivers would now be in a position to go about their tasks with the assurance that their families are secured against risk. This is being done at no cost to the beneficiary. I sincerely hope that this initiative will increase the level of confidence among CNG users. I also hope it will encourage greater safety at all stages in the manufacture, distribution and utilization of CNG. I commend the firm for this initiative.One of the negative consequences of economic growth and rising purchasing power of our people has been the sharp increase in environmental pollution. While we celebrate the prosperity of our people, and their ability to use faster modes of transport, this has also contributed to increased energy consumption and pollution.             A point had been reached in some of our big cities a few years back when it was virtually impossible to breath without difficulty. Even today, in many cities and towns vehicular pollution, both air pollution and noise pollution are harming the quality of life - both of users of vehicles and the non-users. In New Delhi, I remember that only a few years back, it was virtually impossible to go for a walk in the morning and or evening without suffering the effects of pollution. I am told that almost a third of children in Delhi suffer from asthma and other lung diseases.            I do think, however, that one of our great achievements in Delhi in the past couple of years has been our success in reducing pollution levels. All indicators show a marked improvement in air quality. This has been mainly on account of the introduction of unleaded petrol and CNG. I am delighted that Mumbai has also progressed very much in the direction of 100% use of CNG for taxis and autorikshaws. The environmental benefits from the use of CNG as a vehicle fuel have been marked. It is estimated that the current level of CNG usage removes 310 tonnes of harmful pollutants each year from Mumbai's atmosphere. In addition, approximately 3 lakh litres of petrol and 65,000 litres of diesel are conserved every day. I am also told that by using CNG, drivers save almost 70% of the cost as compared to petrol or diesel! I compliment Mahanagar Gas Limited for playing an important role in promoting the use of CNG as a vehicle fuel I am also happy to learn that the Mahanagar Gas Ltd is moving towards covering the entire city of Mumbai through piped gas supply by 2008. I am told that the cost of piped gas is 30% cheaper than LPG and more convenient to deliver. I request MGL and also GAIL to cover all major cities in India with piped gas supply systems so that more families can use a cheaper and cleaner fuel. This should be a priority for the department as well. CNG distribution infrastructure is developing rapidly. I do believe that additional infrastructure is required to ensure speedy and efficient sale of CNG. We also need to promote the use of CNG by private vehicle owners also. MGL should make efforts in this direction so that Mumbai becomes a clean, green city. The success of Delhi Metro has made public transport once again popular. I am aware that Mumbaikars are more used to traveling by public transport. However, Mumbai needs a quantum jump in the quality of public transport. Mumbai cannot continue to depend on a public transport that it has inherited from a distant past. We need more efficient and higher quality public transport. Our Government is committed to creating world class infrastructure, especially public transport, here in Mumbai. I request the state government to speed up work on the Mumbai Metro. The UPA government is a government of the aam aadmi. The concerns of the common man are at the heart of all our programmes. We will work towards creating credible, viable social safety nets for all sections of our society, particularly those who are vulnerable. The Maha Suraksha Yojana is one such effort. We will do more in future. We will see that every citizen of India is well educated, healthy and has the full opportunity of participating in the wonderful growth opportunities that we are unleashing in our economy while taking care of the concerns of the weak and needy. This is our vision of India, an inclusive India. Finally, let me compliment all those associated with this initiative and hope that Mumbai will continue to take the lead in energy conservation and showing social concern. I wish Mahanagar Gas Limited all the very best in its good work."
