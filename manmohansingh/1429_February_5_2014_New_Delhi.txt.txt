	"As you have said, this is probably the last session of Parliament, and it is my sincere appeal to all sections of the House to contribute to creating a feeling, an atmosphere whereby this session will go down in history as a historic session. We have important pieces of legislation ready for approval by Parliament, and I sincerely hope that Parliament will create an environment in which all sections of the House can work together to pass these Bills."
	(On opposition to Telangana)
	"I hope all sections of the House will have the wisdom to set aside these prejudices and create an atmosphere conducive to harmony of working of the House."
