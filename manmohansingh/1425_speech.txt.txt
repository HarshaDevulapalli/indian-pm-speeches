	"I am glad that Ministry of Culture has taken the initiative to begin discharging in right earnest our responsibility of commemorating the 125th Anniversary of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister and a great visionary, statesman and nation-builder. It is important that 125 years of this great son of India should be celebrated in a most befitting manner, especially with a focus on inspiring the younger generation about his life, achievements and contribution, both nationally and internationally.
	I am glad that we have a galaxy of thinkers and experts in this forum. I am sure they will pool in their wisdom and expertise in the formulation of an appropriate plan of action regarding Nehruji’s 125th birth anniversary.
	I will urge all of you to think of creative and meaningful projects which will not only focus on and perpetuate the memory of Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, but also act as the source of inspiration to one and all, especially with reference to his contributions in the field of nation building, democracy, promotion of scientific research and industrial advancement. The commemoration should underline his entire approach to public affairs, ranging from foreign policy to agriculture, from cultural diversity to social harmony, from peaceful co-existence of communities to speedy development of all peoples, especially the under-privileged and backward communities.
	I hope our deliberations today will set the tone for a purposeful implementation of the actual work on ground.
	Thank you."
