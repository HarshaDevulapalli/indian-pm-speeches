The people of India are delighted to host the Nineteenth Commonwealth Games in the historic city of Delhi. It is a proud moment for all our countrymen. I convey my warm greetings to each member of this august gathering of the Commonwealth sporting fraternity.
	 
	I invite all our guests - who have come from every corner of the world - to enjoy our hospitality, to enjoy the Games and to enjoy the incredible sights and sounds of India.
	 
	Millions of people are waiting eagerly to watch this great sporting spectacle unfold.
	 
	Over the next two weeks, we will celebrate and honour sporting excellence on the playing fields. We will see contests of human skill and endurance but above all of courage and character.
	 
	The Games are an occasion to uphold and renew the essential spirit of the Commonwealth that seeks to promote peace, equality and friendship among all people and nations.
	 
	It is participation and sportsmanship, more than winning or losing, which will strengthen the cherished ties of goodwill and understanding that unite us as one family.
	 
	I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons, organizers and fans for a very successful and memorable Nineteenth Commonwealth Games.
	 
	Jai Hind !
