"I extremely happy to be associated with the launch of the 1st Phase of the Goa Broadband Network. This pioneering project is an important milestone in the use of modern telecommunications and IT capabilities for improving public services and also the quality of lives of our people. It is indeed remarkable that such a initiative has come from Goa, whose image is one of modernity and freshness. I compliment the Government of Goa and its partners in this project for having moved forward so rapidly in implementing this project within a short time frame. I hope that as the project rolls out, its benefits will be felt by all sections of Goanese society.  It will then truly become a harbinger of change and modernity into the Goan way of life.            Today, there are a number of forces driving change in our country. One driver is the rapid growth of our economy. As a result of this rapid growth, the basic structural features of our economy are changing in a manner we could not have conceived even a decade ago. From a predominantly agrarian society, we have transformed into a society where industry and services have become the major components of our economy, although agriculture continues to be the source of livelihood for a majority of our people. This transformation to an industrial society is one which other nations have gone through in the past and which we too would have to undergo. This is the only way in which we can provide rising standards of living for all our people. For this to happen, we need to be increasingly better equipped as individuals to be able to participate actively and productively in the industrial and services sectors. This requires that everyone has the right education and has marketable skills. To put it another way, everyone needs "knowledge".  In many ways, knowledge is the key success factor for enabling our people to adjust to the changing economic profile of our country and to find gainful employment in new, emerging sectors.Another force driving change is the rapid improvement in technology in all fields, particularly in telecommunications and IT. This rapid technological change is altering the manner in which production processes are carried out, the manner in which services are delivered and most importantly, the manner in which we work and live. There are a wide range of services that can now be delivered over a telecom link - travel services, healthcare and education.  Most importantly, many jobs can now be performed long-distance, over a telephone or computer link. This has led to the growth of long distance service delivery models, more popularly known as call-centres, Business Process Outsourcing and now, Knowledge Process Outsourcing. If we are to utilize the potential of technology for improving our standards of living, we need to invest in technology and its related tools. In other words, we need an investment in knowledge capabilities.The other driver of change - and possibly the most important one - is the gradual rise in the relative importance of knowledge based work in most areas of human endeavour.  As manufacturing processes become more automated and as technology changes rapidly through innovation, the highest returns go to those who generate "knowledge" and who know how to use "knowledge". The knowledge worker will be the most valuable worker in the evolving knowledge economy. You can see that knowledge is the common strand in all the forces of change. Investment in knowledge and in knowledge tools is therefore going to be the key success factor for individuals or regions or nations. I am happy that a state like Goa has realized the significance of this.  The Goa Broadband Network is a first step in positioning your state for the future. Goa is a beautiful state. Although small in size, it is blessed with extraordinary natural beauty. It occupies a pride of place for its scenic beauty, vibrant culture, tolerant tradition and forward looking people. The warm and hospitable nature of its people has made Goa one of the most sought after international tourist destinations. In many ways, Goa opened the door to large scale tourism into our country. However, size can have its limitations. The potential for industrialization in Goa is limited.  After all, you need to strike a balance between maintaining your pristine natural beauty and the needs of industry. Therefore, focusing on the services sector is a good option for Goa's continued economic growth. Tourism has been one success story. The Goa Broadband Network would hopefully be another. It will open the doors of the knowledge economy to Goan people.Goa is quite well positioned to take advantage of the knowledge economy. Your literacy rates are one of the highest in the country. Your ranking is quite high on many other socio-economic indicators. Being compact and small, you can easily connect all parts of the state with telecom links. Most importantly, you have a warm and welcoming reputation. The Broadband Network, I am told, provides connectivity at the highest speeds available anywhere in the entire country. The Phase launched today connects all state government offices upto the taluka level. As it moves on to the next phase, it will connect every village and household at speeds which are not available elsewhere. It is a matter of immense satisfaction that this project is bridging the digital divide in the State.To begin with, it will enable a large number of government service functions to be delivered on-line. This will make government processes citizen friendly. By the end of next year, as the lines reach each and every home, there would be tremendous service opportunities in new fields such as healthcare, education and employment. Goa would be in a position to provide long distance computer based education and emergency and diagnostic healthcare facilities. People would be able to work out of their homes and the state could see an explosion of knowledge based employment in call centres, BPO centres and online services. The entire state could benefit from low cost access to internet telephony and video-conferencing facilities. I am also happy that all this is being done through the PPP mode based on a viable business model. As the program scales  up from the 10 Citizen Service Centres today to over 200 by the end of next year, it will generate substantial revenues which will meet a major portion of the costs. This is important in two ways. Firstly, it leverages private investment for public IT infrastructure. Secondly, the importance of generating revenues will be an incentive for developing innovative services which meet the needs of users. Often, it has been the low utility value of user-services that has led to the under-utilisation of large government investments in technologies of this type.  I hope the PPP model here will avoid falling into this trap and will constantly support innovation in user services.   The Central Government will offer whatever support is required to improve not only Goa's knowledge sector but also its infrastructure.  I am aware of Goa's desire for an equitable share of facilities for higher education. The Central Government will bear this in mind while locating new institutions for higher learning as envisaged in the 11th Plan. You have a lot of infrastructural bottlenecks. We have approved the four-laning of the entire 139 kms length of NH-17 including a second bridge on the Zuari River under Phase III of the National Highway Development Programme. We have also approved the upgradation of 69 kms of NH 4A. These will involve an investment of over Rs 1500 crores. We will also provide financial assistance for improving state and district roads and the State Government should send detailed proposals in this regard soon. Under Bharat Nirman, we will take up improvement of 760 kms of rural roads at a cost of Rs 150 crores. We will also work for improving the infrastructure of Panaji under the JNNURM. We will also help the state host the 2011 National Games. I once again compliment the State Government for implementing this innovative project. You are a dynamic, progressive state. You have taken the lead in an innovative area. You have begun well. I wish you well in your future endeavours to make Goa a Knowledge State. I am confident that this digital capability combined with your high human development indices will take Goa to higher levels of excellence and prosperity.My best wishes for the New Year.Thank you".
