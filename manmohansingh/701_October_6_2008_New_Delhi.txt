"Well I am very happy to have this opportunity to be present on this occasion and the third volume of this very important journal of the Rumi Foundation is being released. I thank Dr. Karan Singh, I thank Muzaffar Ali Sahib and Saiyyada Imam Sahiba and all of you for being participant in this noble endeavour.             When I look at our civilization there is an element of uniqueness about it.  I recall Alama Iqbal's famous line            Yunan-o-Misra-o-Roma, sab mit gaye Jahan se            Abtak Magar hai baqi, Nam-o-nishan hamara,            Kuchh bat hai ke hasti mitti nahin hamari,            Sadiyon raha hai dushman daur-e-Zaman hamara I often wonder what is it that we have a living civilization of thousands and thousands of years and that it still survives several onslot. This very largely, I think, because of the underlying commitment of our forefathers to the ideas of tolerance, respect for diversity, celebration of diversity. The oneness of all approaches to the realisation of ones maker, paths may differ but the ultimate objective is the same. And therefore it does not behove  any one of us to find fault with the rest of us, I recall, my own convocation when I took my graduation that year the convocation was addressed by no less a person than Dr. S. Radhakrishnan and  there is a couplet which I think is also published in one of his books Kalki - the future of civilizations. He narrated that and that still rings in my ears, "there is so much good in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us that it did not behove any of us to find fault with the rest of us." I think tolerance is what has sustained our civilization and Sufism is a supplanted  manifestation  of that  commitment to tolerance, respect for diversity, and I compliment Muzaffar Ali Sahib and all of you ladies and gentlemen who are engaged in this noble endeavour. May your tribe flourish. At a time when dark clouds are on the horizon, it is only the voice of sanity  and all men and women of goodwill  and understanding must work together to keep the torch  of our civilizational  heritage alive and that you have chosen this path, I compliment you and I salute you. Whatever role that I can play in ensuring that this venture of yours moves from success to success you have my assurance. We will do all that we can to lend a helping hand. I once again thank you for your commitment to a cause  which  represents  the essence of our civilization, a living civilization.  May your tribe flourish."
