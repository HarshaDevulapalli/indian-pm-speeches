I am delighted to have the opportunity, during my visit to Kabul, to lay the foundation stone of the Indian Chancery complex. Since we re-opened our Mission three and a half years ago, India's relations with Afghanistan have developed enormously.There is consensus across the Afghan political spectrum that Indo-Afghan ties should be restored to the old footing and that India is a role model for Afghanistan.This event today is a symbol of our belief that Afghanistan will emerge as a stable, democratic and prosperous country and that India is an important partner in helping to bring about this historic transformation of Afghanistan. There was an unfortunate episode when we had to close our Embassy, when the Taliban entered Kabul in 1996. Fortunately, that phase is behind us now. My visit here today is a sign of our hope for the future of Afghanistan and for the strengthening of our relations with this old friend of India with which we have centuries-old ties of culture and history.I am told that in the past, the Indian Embassy, particularly the Library and the Film Club, enjoyed great popularity among the Afghan people.In fact, they had made a mark on the cultural life of this great city.The new Chancery complex will also house a Library, a multi-purpose hall for exhibitions and cultural performances. I sincerely hope these facilities will enable the Embassy to once again provide a meeting place to promote friendship between the peoples of our two countries.I take this opportunity to commend all the personnel of the Indian Embassy in Kabul and the Consulates in Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif for the excellent job they are doing under exceedingly difficult circumstances.I commend you for your dedication and commitment with which you are promoting the cause of friendship between our two peoples.As the face of the Indian Government and people in this country, you have an important role in strengthening the genuine goodwill that exists between us and in fostering closer friendship between our two countries. I thank you for your efforts and dedication and commitment in performing these onerous duties under very difficult cirnumstancdes.I Thank You all of you. My best wishes for your future.
