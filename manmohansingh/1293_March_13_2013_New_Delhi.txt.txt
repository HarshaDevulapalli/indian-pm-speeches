	There can be no two opinions about the actions that have been taken by the Italian government on the matter raised by the Hon'ble Members.
	Our government has already made it clear that these actions of the Government of Italy are not acceptable.  They violate every rule of diplomatic discourse and call into question solemn commitments given by accredited representatives of a sovereign government to our Supreme Court.
	This cannot, by any standards, be in the interests of any bilateral relationship that has to function on the basis of trust.
	Our government has therefore insisted that the Italian authorities respect the undertakings they have given to the Hon'ble Supreme Court and return the two accused persons to stand trial in India. If they do not keep their word there will be consequences for our relations with Italy.
	I would also urge all members of the House to treat this matter with the seriousness that it deserves, acting and speaking together as the Government moves forward on this issue.
