Real Media - PM's address to the Nation (Hindi)Real Media - PM's address to the Nation (English)Friends,Yesterday, the people of Mumbai and Srinagar once again endured the trauma of terrorism. The nation stands by them in this hour of grief. I pay tribute to all those who showed courage and humanism in responding to the cowardice of terrorists. Your resilience and resolve will triumph over the evil designs of the merchants of death and destruction.This is not the first time that the enemies of our nation have tried to undermine our peace and prosperity. These elements have not yet understood that we Indians can stand united. That we will stand united. They have not yet understood that we will never let them win.I salute the people of Mumbai and Srinagar for the speed with which they have returned to normal life today. This is living proof of our contempt for terrorism.I commend the good work done by the police, the security forces, railway staff, firemen, medical personnel, government officials and others in responding to the tragedy. I commend all our citizens for the concern they have shown in this hour of distress. My heart goes out to those who have lost their loved ones. We will do all that is possible to help each of the families in distress.Mumbai stands tall once again as the symbol of a united India. An inclusive India. Let me say again, no one can make India kneel. No one can come in the path of our progress. The wheels of our economy will move on. India will continue to walk tall, and with confidence.Let me assure you that the Government will do whatever is required to deal with the challenge at hand. We will win this war against terror. Nothing will break our resolve.Brothers and sisters, I urge each one of you to remain calm. Do not be provoked by rumours. Do not let anyone divide us. Our strength lies in our unity. Let us stand together as one people, as one nation. Jai Hind.
