"It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you Madam Prime Minister and the members of your delegation as honoured guests in India. Your visit is testimony to the tremendous importance that both our countries attach to our bilateral relationship.            We have just concluded an intensive and useful exchange of views on the full range of issues that are important in our bilateral ties. As we are friends and neighbours, this encompasses all subjects. Our dialogue was most useful in understanding each other's point of view and in making progress on various issues. Some important Agreements have been signed and these will provide the right framework for guiding and expanding economic and commercial cooperation between our two countries.            We believe sincerely that India and our neighbours all have a common destiny. One cannot prosper without the other and it is only through cooperation within the region that we can compete outside it. We believe it is in our fundamental interest to see a strong, stable and economically strong Bangladesh making its full contribution to regional development.            There is a huge reservoir of goodwill for Bangladesh in India. After all, our culture, language, history and heritage have many common roots. Our people recognize our separate and distinct national identities but draw from a shared consciousness, and cherish a common desire for a life of peace and dignity and for cultural and social upliftment. We can never forget that in the past we have stood shoulder to shoulder to defend these aspirations that we hold so dear.             Both countries have rich intellectual traditions and we must promote much greater interaction between our scholars, intellectuals and opinion makers. It is a matter of satisfaction that today we are able to see Bangladeshi TV channels in India and I understand that they give our local channels stiff competition.            The same poetic voice has given expression to our national identities and to our souls. Our national anthems have been composed by the same great poet, Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam is as revered in India as he is in Bangladesh. Liberal and democratic values are cherished in both countries. The artistic wealth contained in Rabindra Sangeet and Nazrul Geeti is a heritage for both our countries. It is on the basis of these fundamental beliefs that we must build our bilateral relations and take them forward.            As we rededicate ourselves to ever stronger friendship between India and Bangladesh, I wish to conclude with the lines from that immortal poet Kazi Nazrul, whose message of hope is an inspiration and a challenge;Ushar duware hani aghat, amra anibo naya probhat, Amra gocchabo timiro raat, badhar bindhachal"(Striking at the door of dawn, we would usher in a new morning, We would overcome the dark night and the mountains of obstacles.)
