"I am visiting Russia for the next annual bilateral Summit with President Putin. Ever since President Putin's first visit to India in 2000, the practice of holding annual summits has led to the progressive consolidation of our relations and maintained the momentum of our very close high level contacts. The India-Russia Strategic Partnership is an enduring bond of friendship, which has strong historical roots. Our relations with Russia have traditionally been a factor of peace and stability in the region and beyond. I am convinced that the strong fundamentals of mutual trust and a shared world view on regional and global issues would continue to bring our two countries closer together in a dynamic international environment.Our multifaceted bilateral cooperation with Russia is based on long-term interests. The year 2007 is the 60th year of the establishment of India-Russia diplomatic relations. As we rejoice in our joint accomplishments during the six decades of unbroken friendship, we also stand committed to further deepen our partnership in the fields of trade and investment, defence, energy security, science and technology, space and other areas of mutual benefit. I look forward to continuing my discussions with President Putin to further strengthen India's relations with Russia. I will convey to him the high priority that India attaches to its partnership with Russia, and the benefits that this partnership has brought to our two peoples. I am confident that my visit will lead to a reaffirmation of our joint endeavour towards creating greater economic prosperity and a secure, stable and peaceful world order."
