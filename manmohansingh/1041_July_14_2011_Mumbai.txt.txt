"Sonia ji and I have come to Mumbai to share the deep sorrow of the people of Mumbai at this tragedy. Terrorists have struck once again and we have to make collectively every effort to ensure that the injured recover their normal health, those who have lost their dear ones, to them I express our deep sympathy and condolences. Terrorists had the advantage of surprise. This time, there was no prior indication, but the state administration rose remarkably well to the occasion and this occasion in the aftermath of this tragedy, within one hour of this tragedy all the injured persons were sent to various hospitals.There has been remarkable coordination of efforts between the centre and the state government.Now our main task is to find out who the culprits are and how we can work together to bring them to book. I once again convey my deepest condolences to those who have lost their dear ones, to the injured and their families, I pray they will recover their normal health soon."
