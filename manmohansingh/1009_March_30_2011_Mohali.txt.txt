I am very grateful to Prime Minister Gilani for having accepted my invitation to join me in watching this beautiful game of cricket. Cricket has been a uniting factor, it has brought our two Prime Ministers together and I dare say that's a very good beginning. Whatever be the differences between our two countries we have to find pathways to resolve them. And Gilani Sahib and I have had extensive discussions on all outstanding issues and we have reaffirmed our resolve that there are difficulties on the way but we will make every honest effort to overcome those difficulties. And the message from Mohali is that the people of India and Pakistan want to live in peace and amity and that the two Prime Ministers have committed their Governments to work in that direction.
