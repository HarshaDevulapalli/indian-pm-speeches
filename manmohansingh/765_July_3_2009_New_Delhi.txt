	Railway Minister Kumari Mamata Banerjee has done a very competent job in a short period of time. She has presented a budget without imposing any burden by way of increase in freight charges or passenger fare. At the same time she has in keeping with our party's election promise focused on improving amenities for passengers,improving safety and security of railways and making rail travel a desirable experience.
	 
	She has outlined a programme of modernizing 50 railway stations to world class standards. A large number of facilities have been included by way of using the innovative finance mechanism of public private partnerships to improve the productivity of the Railways and to finance more investment. I therefore complement the Railway Minister for a very competent job she has done in a very short period.
