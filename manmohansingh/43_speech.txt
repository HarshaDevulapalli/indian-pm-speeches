 "Friends, I am delighted to be here back amidst all of you, my own people in my adopted home.   Returning to Assam has been a memorable experience this time.  I was of  course here a few months back but that was to join you in you hour of distress.  I had come to lend helping hand and offer relief from the ravages of nature.   This time, I come to share with you your joy.   The inauguration of a new capital complex is a day of great joy and fulfillment for the people of Assam.  I extend to you, Mr. Chief Minister, and to all your colleagues, members of the State legislature, the government and the judiciary and to the people of Assam my heartfelt greetings on this happy occasion.             Friends, this land of yours has been my home for more than a decade.   You, the people of Assam have been more than generous in extending to me your love and affection.   I have made many friends here and I have had the experience of sharing their joys and sorrows.   I have been able to extend my hand of help whenever I could and to whatever extent I could.  I do hope the citizens of Assam feel that I have been able to reciprocate, truly and sincerely, even if not in the measure expected, their love and affection and, above all, their trust and friendship.             Assam is a land of great natural beauty and human talent.   The people of Assam are the inheritors of a great and proud history, of valour and of great learning.  I am sure that Assam's future, like the future of our ancient land is even greater.  It beckons us all.   Let us join hands and work together to build a new Assam, a new India - as a land of people empowered by knowledge and learning, by art and craftsmanship, by the flowering of human capability.    I assure you that it will be my endeavour to be an active part of that process.   I urge you to join me in this adventure of great creativity and enterprise.             A new capital always symbolises a new beginning, a dawn on a new future, the start of a fresh approach to old problems.   Assam has progressed greatly in the last five decades.   It has seen a transformation of its economy and lifestyle.   However, much more needs to be done.  It has also seen its share of problems.  It has also suffered at the hands of nature.   Let the inauguration of the Capital Complex be the start of new processes in Assam which will take the people to new frontiers of prosperity and peace.             In my address, I would like to focus your thoughts on two issues - firstly, floods and second, the economic potential of the region.               Floods have been the scourge of Assam for centuries.   The mighty Brahmaputra, the Barak and other rivers are the lifeblood of Assam.  However, when they decide to vent their fury, they cause devastation and loss of life and property on a scale which is not easy to comprehend in the rest of the country.   Year after year, the people of Assam have suffered this devastation quietly, with patience and fortitude.             I visited Assam in July this year and saw the suffering of the people.  We gave substantial assistance to the State, assistance which was prompt, timely and fast.   The manner in which we in Delhi responded to the distress in Assam, both physical and financial, was unprecedented.  It demonstrates our commitment to helping the people and the State of Assam.             However, the problem of floods has many dimensions to it.   There is an inter-state dimension.   Most, if not all, rivers flow across state boundaries.   Therefore, any lasting solution requires attention to be paid to both upper and lower reaches, with these lying in different states.    The other dimension is international.  Some rivers originate in other countries and flow into other countries.   There is also the issue of short-term solutions versus long-term solutions.  The former provide immediate relief but are inadequate in the long run.   The latter provide long-term solutions but take time to fructify.             I had announced the formation of a Task Force to address the problem of floods in the North-East and other States.   The Task Force is working on establishing the modalities for tackling this vexed problem.   At the same time, we are also working on revamping and strengthening the Brahmaputra Board so as to enable it to become a more effective body.              I have been wondering whether we have the appropriate institutional arrangements to address floods in Assam and neighbouring states.  May be it is time for us to think of new institutions to handle the gigantic task ahead of us.   It is possible that tinkering with institutions at the edges may not suffice.  May be the time has come for a great leap forward in our approach to the problem.  It is worth considering for a great leap forward in our approach to the problem.  It is worth considering whether we need to establish a cohesive, autonomous, self-contained entity on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority of the USA or the Damodar Valley Corporation to address this perennial problem  it could be called the Brahmaputra Valley Authority or the North-East Valley Authority.   This body would develop the river areas to provide effective flood control, generate electricity, provide irrigation facilities and develop infrastructure.   Given managerial and financial autonomy with top class manpower, and backed up by Parliamentary sanction, such a body would be the instrument for transforming the region.   It could be the instrument for providing a "New Deal" for Assam.   We will apply our minds to the creation of such an institution.             Looking into the future, we need to apply our mind to the development of the region on a sustainable.   Assam has immense potential.   It is well endowed with natural and human resources.   The beauty of the people and State is matched by its potential.   However, we need to ask how do we fulfill this potential?  How can we ensure that the people of Assam fully benefit from the rapid progress being made by the economy.             Our government is committed to investing heavily in education, health and agriculture in Assam.   We are also working towards the development of infrastructure in the State.  We are particularly concerned about improving the connectivity of the region with the rest of the country.   Investment in physical and human capital will enable Assam to integrate itself much better with the growth processes in the country.             At this point, I would like to draw your attention to a larger economic framework which is opening up great opportunities for this region.  I have been saying that this century is going to be Asia's century and that China and India are going to be major economies of this century.   This is borne out by any number  of studies and forecasts.   This is part of our "Look-East" policy as well.    As we develop our economic and trade links with SE Asia and the Far East, Assam and the North East can be the springboard from which we launch into intense economic integration with our neighbours.   Assam can become an centre-pot, a centre of commerce and trade, where goods, ideas and people from any lands meet and interact, both economically and intellectually.   We are entering into Free Trade Agreements and Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements with Thailand, Singapore and ASEAN so that our trade and economic relations intensify further.  I am sure that in this process, we have a vision of Assam as the Gate of India to the east.   If the gateway of India in Mumbai symbolizes the might of the colonial British Empire, this Gateway to the East represents a resurgent India, an economically strong India, an India  which is integral to the Asian century.   The future is beckoning us and it is for us to make it happen.  I commit our Government to making Assam the centre of our great economic enterprise towards the East, an enterprise full of challenge, creativity and potential.             There are many other areas where we are supporting Assam.  The national Games are due to be held here next year.  We have been providing financial support and will work together to make the Games a success.   We are also working on a reconstruction plan for flood-affected areas by restoring roads, bridges and embankments.  We are very keen to protect the Majuli Island from flood and erosion.  I understand how Majuli plays an important role in the socio-cultural sentiments of the people of Assam.  We will assist the Government of Assam in tackling the problems of Majuli.             One area in which Assam has been seeking assistance is employment.   With over 16 lakh unemployed youth, employment generation is a major priority for the State.  I am happy to know that there are 65,000 Self Help Groups in Assam.  I have been informed that NABARD will provide credit linkage to over 20,000 Groups this year.   We will also work with the Government of Assam for rejuvenating the tea industry which is a major sector of the state economy.             I agree much more needs to be done.  I commit to work together with Planning Commission and other organisations for a visible, feasible blueprint to generate employment.   I also commit that the Government will honour implementation of the Assam Accord in letter and spirit.   I tell the youth, don't resort to the gun to achieve your objective and you have a Prime Minister from Assam who will listen to you.  Come and join me to write a new chapter in the history of Assam.             I would like to conclude by saying once again that let this new Capital Complex be the foundation for an economically dynamic Assam, an Assam which will be India's Gateway to the East, which will be in the forefront of India's march to the future".
