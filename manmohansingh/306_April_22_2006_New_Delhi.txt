"I will be visiting Hannover and Berlin at the invitation of Chancellor Merkel of Germany. My visit is part of the annual summit meetings between our two countries as part of our strategic partnership. During my visit, I will also be calling on President Horst Kohler. My visit to Germany will provide an opportunity to further strengthen relations with one of the major European powers and a valuable partner on global issues. Germany is one of the world's foremost trading nations. It is one of India's most important business partners and among the major foreign investors in our country. My visit to Germany coincides with India's participation as a Partner Country in the prestigious Hannover Fair 2006, which is the world's largest technology exhibition. India participated as a Partner Country the last time at the Hannover Fair 22 years ago. Over 300 Indian Companies including PSUs, large corporate houses as well as small and medium enterprises and all the main Chambers of Commerce and Industry will be participating in this event, which will show case the vast potential for partnership that India offers for trade, industry and technological collaboration through mutual benefit. I will also be inaugurating the Indian Pavilion. On my way back, I will be paying a bilateral visit to Uzbekistan at the invitation of President Islam Karimov. Both countries share longstanding ties and deep rooted cultural and civilizational links. Uzbekistan is an important country in the Central Asian region which we consider part of our extended neighbourhood. We hope to build on our traditional ties in providing them with new meaning and substance including in the political, economic, defence, energy, science and technology and cultural fields."
