Madam Speaker, I rise not to reply to the various points that have been made in the debate but merely to add my voice to the feelings that I have heard being expressed in this august House.Â  That what has been happening in the last few days in some parts of our country, the growing sense of insecurity among people from the North-East living in different parts of our country; that this is something, which is more reprehensible; that all of us should work together to get this sort of situation brought under control without any further loss of time.
I commit from the Government to work with all like-minded people to create a feeling of security among the people of the North-East residing in various parts of our country that they have as much right as anyone else to live, to earn and to study at wherever place they may go.
The unity and integrity of our country is being threatened by certain elements; and without apportioning blame, I would urge this House to send a message loud and clear to all the people of the North-East residing in different parts of our country that our people are one, that will do everything to provide security to the people of the North-East residing in various parts of our country; and that this is an obligation, which we will discharge to the best of our ability, with all political parties joining hands to send out a clear message to the people of the North-East that we will work to restore peace and amity so that the this feeling of insecurity is brought under control.
