This session of Parliament is going to transact the important financial business before the house, and it is our sincere hope that we will have a productive, constructive debate, leading to agreed solutions to the many national problems that our country faces. I have said this before and I repeat it again. Parliament is a forum for discussion, for dialogue, and all parties have an obligation to ensure that Parliament runs smoothly. And I am hopeful and I am confident that this session is going to be a fruitful session. This is a session, as I said, which is going to deal with the financial business, and our country faces many economic challenges, and it is my sincere hope that all political parties will join hands to find productive, constructive solutions to the formidable challenges facing our Nation.
