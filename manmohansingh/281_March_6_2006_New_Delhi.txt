"It is a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister John Howard and his delegation to India. This is Prime Minister Howard's second visit to India and he has just completed ten years as Prime Minister and I congratulate him on that important milestone. Prime Minister John Howard and I have completed a very cordial and productive discussion today. We exchanged views on a number of important bilateral and regional issues. Our relations with Australia are developing well in diverse areas including trade in goods and services, investment, defence, security, education, science and technology, environment, civil aviation and sports. Today, we have signed six Agreements including a Trade and Economic Framework, an Air Services Agreement, MoUs on Cooperation in Defence, Customs and Biotechnology and a Letter of Intent on the establishment of a Strategic Research Fund. We look forward to the further enhancement of our bilateral ties and closer cooperation in regional fora. The emerging regional architecture is an important focus of both countries and we have committed to working together to strengthen peace and cooperation in the Asia Pacific region. Relations between Australia and India are evolving into a strong partnership and India is committed to working with Australia to upgrade our bilateral relationship in all areas. May I now invite you Mr. Prime Minister to make some comments if you wish, before we invite questions."
