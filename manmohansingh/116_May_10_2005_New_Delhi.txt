"I have learnt from the media regarding the controversy generated by a letter regarding the conduct of Election Commissioners during the last Lok Sabha elections. The Law Minister has gone on record that he has not received any such letter. The Election Commission is a Constitutional Body which has played a critical and positive role in the successful functioning of our democracy. Since Independence, it has had an impeccable track record of conducting elections and is widely respected for its work. India today is emerging on the global scenario as a confident, progressive and rapidly growing economy, which has managed to build a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious society within a democratic framework. It is this success of India in harmoniously managing the dual processes of economic development and democratic governance which is being seen by many as a role model for the world. In this context, it is important that the entire nation understands the importance of Constitutional institutions such as the Election Commission for their contribution to earning India the respect and admiration of the world. It is incumbent on all to ensure that the essential institutions of a democratic framework are respected, their sanctity maintained and their autonomy preserved in a manner which will ensure that they continue to contribute to our democratic life. This responsibility vests both in those within the institutions and in those outside. It is in this perspective that all issues should be examined. Nothing should be done which can lead to an unwanted weakening of our democratic institutional fabric."
