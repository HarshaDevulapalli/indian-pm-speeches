"There is someone who said, 'truth is learning from facts' and I am grateful to my colleagues Shri Shivraj Patilji, for giving me this opportunity to know first-hand what are the inadequacies, what are these challenges, that police services face in our country in discharging their onerous duties. I have listened with great respect to the presentations that have been made and I do feel that the time has come when we should be integrating policing also into our planning for development purposes.            This old fashioned division between the development expenditure and non development expenditure has outlived its utility and I will go back and discuss with the Planning Commission, with the Home Ministry, how best we can develop our so-called development and the so-called non-development sectors of our economy. I do feel listening to the presentations that have been made that there is an urgent need to look into the future what type of police system our country needs in grappling with the challenges that are now on the horizon and where we are, how much distance we have to travel in order to ensure that we provide our country a police system which is adequate to the challenges that our country faces. So this is one thing, which I would say - we have in our systems five-year planning for the defence forces. I would suggest to the Hon'ble Home Minister that may be time has come we should form a five year, or may be a longer term perspective plan which would take into account the imperative need for upgrading our technology, our human resource strategies and all the other related subjects which have been discussed. In particular, I was very fascinated by a suggestion that in certain insurgency affected areas, police should be involved in development work. I am reminded by what my esteemed friend, Mr. Shivraman who was at one time, Cabinet Secretary in the Government of India and the Chief Secretary of Orissa. He told me about the link between the police system and the development works. He said to me that as Chief Secretary, he once received a number of senior police officers and the police officers said that the general perception the public about the police is not very good. We want to do something which would change that perception and Mr. Shivraman said at that time, there was talk of introducing the new miracle seeds, the Green Revolution was just beginning, so he suggested, to the police officers, that may be the policemen should be involved in distributing these new hybrid seeds. And to his surprise, he said he found that when this task was entrusted to the police, I think the performance on the ground was much better.  Of course, he added, that it was because the people were so afraid of police that they did what they were told. But, I do recognize and I do recall that when I was the Finance Minister, General Roy Choudhury, who was then the head of our Army, came to me with a similar proposal that the armed forces should be involved in some social work and we agreed that health care, looking at schooling - primary schooling is a good way, not only in North-East, but in Jammu and Kashmir some experiments were performed and from whatever I have been told I think these experiments have given a humane face to this grim struggle against insurgency and related matters in some parts of our country.            One thing that I do wish to say is that 80% of the police personnel belong to the category of constables, and I think this is certainly true, that we have not paid adequate attention to ensuring that the constables of the future are being produced by our policing system. Some years ago, I was told in Maharashtra that 75% of policemen live in 'chawls' in slum areas, where they interact all the time with criminal elements. Now, out of that policing system, you cannot produce men and women of integrity. I think there are lot of temptations to fall off the chosen path of rectitude. So, we have to pay a lot more attention to ensuring that we provide adequate facilities for our constables - housing facilities, certainly have to improved, but also training their psychological, mental make-up, and this also applies to many police schools also. The Constitutional values of our Republic, respect for diversity, respect for inclusiveness and a deep and abiding commitment to secular values that people belonging to all faiths have an equal claim to the protection of law and of the state. These are some of the other issues, which I believe ought to receive a lot more attention as we plan for the future. Therefore, I am very happy to be here today to participate in this interaction with you. I have a learnt a great deal. I hope that the Home Ministry will follow up on the suggestions that have been made, cull out a list of urgent areas, where there is need for immediate action, also devise a strategy where we can act - may be not immediately, but over a period of time, a medium and a long term strategy, giving our country a police system which is equal to the challenges that our country faces.            I have had this chance to sit through the presentations. It is heartening for me to note that inspite of the rigours of your daily routine, you have all retained the analytical abilities to understand the problems that lie at the core of your work and come up with possible solutions to improve police administration at the grassroots. The ability to analyse and resolve issues in a turbulent and changing world, keeping in view the larger national interest is the fundamental reason why this country needs an All India Service like yours. You have been charged with the onerous responsibility of maintaining law and order and in ensuring peace and security across the length and breadth of our country.  Law and order is fundamental to the existence of a functioning democracy and a civilised society. The Rule of Law is the bedrock of a modern economy. As the instrument for maintaining the rule of law, an efficient, effective and an accountable police administration is one of the most important institutions of the modern state. And as the managers of police forces at the grassroots, you have to ensure that this instrument is effective, efficient, caring, just, as well as responsive.            The police system has evolved over the last one and a half centuries. It is still governed by the Police Act of 1861. At that time, when the police force was created, the sole consideration was of defending the establishment rather than providing sensitive and friendly policing to our people. The police forces were to serve the interests of rulers and not people. Times have changed since then.  We are an independent and democratic nation which takes pride in its civil liberties, its rule of law and its judicial system. In such a framework as we are in today, there is a need to have in the police forces a managerial philosophy, a value system and an ethos in tune with the changing needs of our times.            Building such a culture, I believe, is one of the most important challenges that all police officers must address on a priority basis. We need to ensure that police forces at all levels, and even more so at the grassroots, change from a feudal force to a democratic service. Police forces need to be seen as a friend of the citizen, someone in whom a common man should repose trust and faith. There was a time when the neighbourhood policeman was regarded as a friend, as a protector. Today, most people try to avoid approaching a policeman for help. They are either convinced that a policeman is ineffective and unlikely to help or that he or she is likely to make matters worse. If one reads from reports in the press and even from occasional experiences of individuals, there is still a long distance to cover in transforming our police forces to this ideal.            There is therefore a need to ensure honesty in our forces. There is a need to ensure transparency in our dealings, with our citizens and also within our own forces. As young bright officers, you have the ability to make this transformation happen. It is my sincere hope that all of you will examine the manner in which your forces are functioning and take steps to attain this ideal.            Reference was made to frequent transfers. I have stated on a number of occasions in the last 15 months that I have been Prime Minister, that frequent, arbitrary transfers of officials, demoralise our administration, and that we have to find ways and means to deal with this pernicious phenomena.  Soon after I took office, I wrote to the Chief Ministers, drawing their attention to this practice. I must confess that I have not succeeded in carrying convictions with the Chief Minister, but I haven't given up and I propose to persist, because I am convinced that the onerous duties and responsibilities which our District Collectors and District Superintendents of Police are required to carry out, cannot be carried out when there is excessive uncertainty of tenure, arbitrary transfers take place causing great deal of mental anguish, particularly to officers with young children. I am acutely aware of this gap in our performance and I propose to persist with the Chief Ministers, until an effective, workable solution to this problem is found.     Today, nations and Governments all over the world confront an extraordinary range of threats. New challenges are emerging each day. Momentous changes are taking place all around us that have a profound influence on the security environment that our country faces. We face many daunting challenges at home but we can derive strength from the fact that our democracy has endured many challenges before. The police and security forces have played a very important role in enabling our country to endure and surmount these challenges.  You are entitled to our respect and our gratitude.Today, when we speak of security threats we must understand that these embrace a multitude of dangers, and not necessarily only the threats of external aggression, or internal turbulence. There are several subversive forces at work, including in the economic realm. Economic globalization and technological development have altered the nature of crime, giving rise to new forms of white-collar crime. These co-exist with the most primitive forms of extortion, and trafficking in arms, drugs, narcotics and women. Migration of people with large movements across national borders - and even within countries has become an explosive issue in many parts of the world. Antagonisms arising from a resurgence of religious bigotry and the specter of religious fundamentalism and communalism threaten secular values and liberal democracy. I am convinced that India presents a unique opportunity to the world. Our way of life, a country of a billion people with all the religions of the world being represented in this vast country of ours, trying to carve out their salvation in the framework of an open economy and an open society. I think such a thing has never happened in human history before and therefore, this 'Idea of India' a tolerant and inclusive, a humane civilisation is an idea, which in the 21st century acquires a great deal of relevance when people are talking in terms of clash of civilisations. Our country is a shining example, which proves to the world that the future of the world lies not in the clash of civilisations, but in confluence and dialogue among civilisations. This is value system, which we must nurture and I sincerely hope that all our training academies must pay adequate attention to this aspect of our curriculum.Urban crime, rape and violence against women are on the rise. These are fuelled by increasing disparities between the haves and have-nots, made sharper by its greater visibility, thanks to the new media forms. Visible contrasts in lifestyles, rising expectations and the breakdown of traditional family structures may also be contributing to increased urban violence. Today, I about thirty per cent of the population lives in urban areas - in 20 years time, probably 50 per cent of the population will be living in urban areas.  Therefore, I listen with great interest to the problem of policing in the new urban milieu that is now on the horizon.  I hope that some thing concrete will be done to grapple with the challenges of policing in the new metropolis and the urban areas that cannot be simply wished away. I do not want to discuss here what social, economic and political factors may be contributing to these various trends. Suffice it to say that the best safeguard against such threats is the confidence of all sections of our society in the supremacy of the rule of law, in the system's fairplay and justice and in our commitment to the fundamental values of our magnificent Constitution. But, above all, the people must have confidence in the professionalism of our police, its honesty, its integrity and its efficiency. Whatever deficiencies have been pointed out, they need to be addressed on a priority basis.  The police and security forces must be viewed as friends of the people, of ordinary, honest citizens, even as they instill fear in law- breakers and enemies of the Indian State. Our commitment to secularism and to the equality of all - irrespective of religion, region, caste or community is an important guarantor of social peace and harmony in our country. Fundamentalism feeds on sectarianism, politics of exclusion and insecurity of the weak. We must take care to ensure that the dominant, silent majority has faith, retains faith in the Government's ability and willingness to be fair-minded and just, even as we are resolute and determined to uphold the rule of law. It is on this basis that we can create the social and political environment necessary for sustained economic and social development. Investment, as I have often said, is in the final analysis, an act of faith. That faith in our future is shaped by the social, political and economic environment that prevails in the country at large. You have, therefore, an important role to play in the economic resurgence of our country by ensuring the rule of law and preserving law and order.            I do sincerely hope that you and your colleagues in the police force refuse to succumb to unwarranted interference in your professional work and have the courage of conviction and commitment to your service to stand up and be counted. I recognise the difficulties that you face.  I recognize the consequences of degeneration in our politics.  But somewhere, we must draw a line.  Somewhere there must be - when men and women are to be found who will say - thus far and no more.  That's the only way we can preserve and carry forward the 'Idea of India' and also ensure that our country gets our rightful place in the comity of nations.  No one can protect the élan, preserve the morale and sustain the reputation of your service, but yourselves. Adherence to professional codes of conduct is important, necessary and possible, though I know at times, it is very difficult.  I do believe that each one of us can make a difference. We must at least try.            I am particularly aware of the fact that our police force requires modernization and training in new technologies. I will work with the Home Ministry and the Planning Commission to draw up a blueprint of a modernised police force, a 5-10 year perspective and then work with the State Governments to ensure that our police forces are equipped - resource-wise as well as whatever other wherewithals they need to meet the challenges that we face in these trying times.  But I also urge you to also insist on regular refresher courses, daily exercise and physical fitness programmes and adoption of modern management concepts in running police stations. We need additional resources, there is no doubt about that.  But there are a lot of things, which can be done without extra money.  It is not very fashionable these days to quote Joseph Stalin, but I recall a conversation which the very famous Russian physicist - Kapitza who was working at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, in the early part of the 20th century, went back to Russia and Stalin imprisoned him.  Kapitza asked for an audience with Stalin and when taken there, he asked Stalin, 'why have you kept me back in Russia?  I am doing creative science in England, here, I have no resources, I have no facilities, what can I do?  And Stalin's answer was - 'my dear young man, it is precisely because we are short of resources, we must use our brains'.  There are many things, which can be achieved through managerial innovativeness, even when resources are in short supply.  But I do recognize that the need for additional resources cannot be wished away and our police services must be given those additional resources.  We must have the concept of a modern police station and we must have the ambition to replicate that model all over the country.  We shall attempt that in the next 5-10 years.The Indian Police Service must renew itself and attain new heights of glory. There was a time when the officers and staff of the Malabar police, the Punjab Police, the Delhi Police and other units were highly respected and also feared by criminals. We must regain that pride in our uniform and earn the affection, respect and awe of our communities. Force alone cannot be the weapon of the police force. A humane and efficient police force can infact be more effective in discharging its responsibilities than an aggressive and corrupt one.             I hope your conference has been able to address some of these challenges you face in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities. I would suggest to the Home Minister to consider establishing an independent police performance board that enables government to monitor and assess police performance in an objective manner. The Home Minister may also consider setting up an independent oversight mechanism to handle complaints against police misconduct.             I hope you will return to your watch with a new sense of purpose and renewed commitment to the values of your service. The nation looks up to you to be alert, tough, decisive, fair, just and humane. It is not an easy job, but it is a job to be done. I wish you well in your noble endeavours".
