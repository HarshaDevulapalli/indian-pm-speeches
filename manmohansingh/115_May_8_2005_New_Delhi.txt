India will be present along with several important countries at this commemorative event.On this occasion, we recall the immense sacrifices made by Russia and other allied countries in defeating the forces Fascism and Nazism in the Second World War. Several thousand Indian troops also laid down their lives in this cause.We attach the highest importance to our relations with Russia, which has been a tried and tested friend, and has stood by us in times of need. I look forward to my meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Our discussions will aim to build upon the successful visit of President Putin to India in December last year and the common objective we share of further consolidating our relations of strategic partnership. The high momentum that characterizes our relations will be further demonstrated by the fact that the Rashtrapathiji will be a paying a State Visit to the Russian Federation later this month.
