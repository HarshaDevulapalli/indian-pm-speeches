This is a very important part of the session of Parliament. Important financial business is before the House. There are also important Bills like the Food Security Bill, the Land Acquisition Bill, which require to be passed. And it is my sincere wish that the House should be allowed to function. If there are any concerns of the Opposition, we are willing to debate all those issues which worry the Opposition. Therefore my request to all members of the Opposition is to let the Government function. We have been put in this position by the people of India to deliver certain goods, and we hope that everyone would cooperate in that process: that the budget is passed, that essential business contained in other important Bills is also dealt with effectively.
