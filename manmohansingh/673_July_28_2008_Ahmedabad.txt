Congress President Smt. Sonia Gandhiji, Home Minister Shri Shivraj Patilji, and I have come to express our solidarity with the people of Gujarat in their hour of crisis.  I commend the people of Gujarat for the resilience they have shown.  These terrorist acts are aimed at destroying our social fabric, undermining communal harmony and demoralizing our people.  As the people of Gujarat have shown so admirably, these efforts will not succeed.  We will rise to the challenge and I am confident we will be able to defeat these forces. All political parties, the Central and State Governments, the Central and State police and intelligence authorities and civil society groups should cooperate and work together to this end.  In this hour of tragedy, my heart goes out to those who have lost their near and dear ones.  I offer my sympathies to those injured.  We will do our best to take care of them.  And my deepest prayers for the departed souls.
