	I extend my warm greetings to the distinguished delegates of this conference, which is being held to find ways and means of meeting a major public health challenge of the 21st century.
	According to estimates of the World Health Organisation, tobacco consumption was responsible for 100 million deaths in the 20th century and will claim one billion lives in this century, unless it is stopped with firm resolve.  Apart from causing death and disability in high numbers, the use of tobacco also imposes other serious costs on the economy and society.  Poverty is now well recognised to be a possible consequence of tobacco consumption.  The wood fuel need for curing tobacco leaf and the high volume of pesticides used in tobacco farming are a threat to the environment. 
	Tobacco control calls for a combination of political and public health action.  Together, multi-sectoral policies and public awareness must drive down both demand and supply.
	India is firmly committed to the vision of a tobacco-free society.  Our Parliament unanimously enacted a comprehensive legislation for tobacco control in 2003.  India is also a party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in whose development and adoption we played a pivotal role.
	We have recently banned the sale of ‘ghutka’, a widely consumed form of oral tobacco.  Bans on advertising of tobacco products and smoking in public places are also in place.
	As we act with conviction and commitment to eliminate tobacco as a threat to human health, we must also assist those engaged in tobacco farming or manufacture to move towards economically viable alternate livelihoods.
	I am sure this conference will contribute substantially to developing implementable and impactful strategies for stamping out tobacco as a danger to our collective future.
	I wish you all success in your deliberations.
