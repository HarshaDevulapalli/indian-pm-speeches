" I am visiting Mauritius at the official invitation of Mr. Paul Raymond Berenger, Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius. I will be calling on President Sir Anerood Jugnauth as well as addressing the Mauritian National Assembly. I will be meeting the Leader of Opposition, Dr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam. India and Mauritius enjoy traditional bonds of friendship and kinship founded on a historical and shared cultural heritage. My visit is intended to further strengthen the vast framework of our bilateral interactions with the objective of deepening and widening in every possible way our special and unique relationship with Mauritius. In this context, I hope to discuss with the Mauritian leadership, ways of further deepening the economic content of our relations through the early conclusion of negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement. Aspects related to strengthening our cooperation in defence and security areas, including counter terrorism, human resource development, air links and cultural contacts are also expected to figure in our discussions. India has provided support and assistance to Mauritius to emerge as a knowledge hub. The Chairperson of UPA, Smt. Sonia Gandhi, inaugurated the Rajiv Gandhi Science Centre during her visit to Mauritius on November 28 last year. The Cyber Tower at Ebene constructed with Indian assistance to strengthen the capacities of Mauritius in the field of information and communication technology will be inaugurated during my visit. I look forward to an exchange of views on regional and international issues on which both countries have traditionally shared common perceptions. We see Mauritius as a friendly gateway to the African continent and an invaluable partner at multilateral fora."
