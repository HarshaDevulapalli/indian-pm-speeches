The news of the serial bomb blasts in the capital New Delhi reached me on my arrival in Kolkata after a day's visit to Tripura. I decided immediately that these acts required my presence in Delhi and I cut short my engagements for tomorrow at Kolkata and returned to Delhi. I share the shock and distress of all those affected by these blasts. My heart grieves for those who have lost their loved ones. I condemn the cynical and the pre-mediated attacks on innocent people. These are dastardly acts of terrorism aimed at the people of our country. These terrorists wish to spread a sense of fear and suspicion among peace loving people. These blasts have been timed to create disaffection during the festival season when people of all communities are celebrating our national festivals. We shall defeat their nefarious designs and will not allow them to succeed. We are resolute in our commitment to fighting terror in all forms. I am confident that the people of India have the will, the capacity and the resolution to win the war against terrorism.I urge the people to remain calm, not to panic or believe rumours and ensure that we go about our normal activities. The government will take all possible measures to maintain law and order and defeat the forces of terrorism.
