"I will be visiting Cebu, Philippines, for the 5th India-ASEAN Summit and the 2nd East Asia Summit.  Our participation in both these summits is a reflection of the increasing significance of the eastern orientation of India's foreign policy and our quest for closer engagement with countries of South-East Asia and East Asia.In Cebu, I will participate in the 5th India-ASEAN Summit on January 14th, which will be followed by the 2nd East Asia Summit the next day.  At the India-ASEAN Summit I will have an opportunity to review, with leaders of ASEAN countries, the progress that has been achieved over the last year in India's economic dialogue with the ASEAN region.  We will also consider new initiatives that can be undertaken to accelerate this process of engagement.  I believe that the India-ASEAN FTA is an important initiative to promote this greater economic synergy and I shall use this opportunity to explore steps that both sides can take to hasten the conclusion of this important agreement.  The 2nd East Asia Summit on 15th January will provide an opportunity to take forward, a process that was initiated last year to put in place a regional architecture for greater cooperation and economic integration amongst countries of East Asia.  The East Asia Summit agenda includes energy security, stability of the regional financial system, mitigating natural disasters, environment, and other subjects of common interest that can only be tackled effectively within a broad inclusive framework.On the sidelines of the Summit meeting I will have the opportunity of meeting my counterparts from other countries including President Arroyo of Philippines who is our host, Premier Wen Jiabao of China, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam among others.I am looking forward to this visit and to utilizing it to elevate India's engagements in South-East Asia and East Asia to qualitatively new levels."
