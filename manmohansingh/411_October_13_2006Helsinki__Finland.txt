This Partnership is firmly based on the shared values of democracy, pluralism, rule of law and respect for human rights. The two sides adopted a comprehensive and forward looking Joint Action Plan at the sixth EU-India Summit at New Delhi. Since then the EU and India have been working together closely to build on and take forward their Strategic Partnership at a bilateral and global level. The two leaders welcomed the progress achieved in the implementation of the Joint Action Plan and reaffirmed their commitment to take it forward.3. The leaders welcomed the steady, significant intensification of the dialogue between the strategic partners. The level of engagement between India and individual EU Member States has also been qualitatively enhanced. Practical steps have been taken in setting up a number of new consultation mechanisms. The number of official visits has multiplied. Over and beyond this has been the marked expansion of formal as well as informal day-to-day contacts at working level between experts on subjects across the board. EU-India cooperation will be further enhanced through efforts to work towards facilitating the movement of businesspersons, professionals and tourists, as well as researchers, scientists, students and academics between India and the EU Member States.4. The EU and India stand committed to the rules-based multilateral trading system. The successful outcome of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) multilateral trade negotiations remains their foremost trade policy priority, and they agreed to ensure that the deepening of bilateral trade relations supports the larger multilateral trading regime.5. The rapidly growing flows of two-way trade and investment between the EU and India reflect the strengthening of bilateral ties. Leaders on both sides encouraged an expansion and deepening of trade and investment linkages. Recognising that stronger economic engagement is mutually advantageous and would buttress the Strategic Partnership, the leaders decided to advance their bilateral trade relations. The Summit welcomed the work done by the High Level Trade Group and endorsed the case made for a future broad-based bilateral trade and investment agreement. The Summit agreed that both sides move towards negotiations for such an agreement.6. The close association of industry and business in EU-India cooperation as well as dialogue between businesses from both sides are crucial to achieving the common goal of enhancing trade and investment. The EU-India Business Summit, and the launch of the EUIndia CEO Round Table held in Helsinki yesterday, have provided for useful and constructive interactions among key Business leaders from both sides.7. The EU and India are committed to promoting international peace and security and working together towards achieving economic progress, prosperity and sustainable development, as well as promoting good governance. Both the EU and India are committed to upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms. The two sides will continue, in a spirit of equality and mutual respect, the dialogue on human rights both in a multilateral and bilateral context.8.

They regard the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including the risk of their falling into the hands of terrorists and other non-state actors, as a major threat to international peace and security. In this context they emphasised the importance of full compliance by all States with their existing obligations through national implementation as well as UNSC (United Nations Security Council) Resolution 1540. They agreed that effective national export control measures for dual use goods, with due regard for cooperation for peaceful purposes, play a crucial role in preventing proliferation.11. The leaders expressed deep concern at the reported nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in violation of its international commitments. They agreed that the test jeopardises regional peace and stability and highlights the importance of countering proliferation. Leaders urged the DPRK to return immediately and without preconditions to the Six-Party Talks.12. The leaders emphasised the urgent need for the international community to promote a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East / West Asia, with the objective of reaching a comprehensive, just and durable peace and stability in the region.

The leaders expressed strong, continuing support for the efforts of Norway as the facilitator to bring peace to Sri Lanka.17.

The EU and India stand united in facing the scourge of terrorism, which constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The EU and India condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purpose. The fight against terrorism can only succeed if it is sustained and comprehensive. The EU and India, therefore, attach great importance to counter-terrorism cooperation in the framework of the United Nations and share a commitment to universal ratification and full implementation of all international counter-terrorism conventions and related protocols. The EU and India continue to work actively towards a swift finalisation of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the UN.

Both the EU and India attach high priority to energy security as a key to stable and sustainable development. Energy is an important area of ongoing and future policy dialogue and practical cooperation between the EU and India.

They underlined the importance of encouraging and promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production to lessen the causes and adverse impacts of climate change. They particularly emphasised the need to exploit, as appropriate, the synergies between the promotion of energy security, sustainable energy supply, innovation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in order to move to a low-carbon future.22. The EU and India recognise the critical role of science and technology (S&T;) in striving towards their respective knowledge-based economies and the mutual benefits of further strengthening joint research and S&T; cooperation. The leaders look forward to the renewal of the EU-India S&T; agreement in 2007. Both sides welcomed India's full membership in the ITER project.23. Given the healthy growth and potential in two-way trade, tourism, research and student exchanges, and business between the EU and India, the leaders recognised the importance of strengthening transportation links in order to further promote and facilitate exchanges.
