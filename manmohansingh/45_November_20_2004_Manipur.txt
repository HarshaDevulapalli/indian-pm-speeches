 "This is a historic day for all of us.  I am happy to be with you all on this solemn occasion of the handing over of the Kangla Fort Complex to the Government of Manipur.           The Kangla Fort is coming under the direct control of the State Government for the first time after it was conquered by the forces of the British Empire in 1891.  This historic event is taking place three days after the birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi who as the Prime Minister of India had inaugurated the formation of the Manipur State on 21st January 1972 and said that "Manipur is a real 'gem' (a Mani) of India" "It is our wish", said Indiraji, "that Manipur may shine like a gem and impart beauty to the whole of India".           If Manipur is, as Pandit Nehru said, the Jewel of India, then Kangla Fort is the Crowning Jewel.  Kangla Fort is the nucleus of the Manipur State and symbolizes not only temporal power but also the spiritual and religious traditions of the people.  Around it grew Manipur and its ethos and Manipur held sway with the majesty of its political authority, the might of its military prowess and the glory of its sacred realm.           The ancient heritage of Manipur and its tradition of bravery continue to echo throughout the length and breadth of the State and inspires the rest of the country.  The Kangla Fort exemplified the bravery of Manipuris and witnessed many a fierce battle against British authorities who wanted to capture it and conquer its people.  In India's struggle for independence the Kangla Fort had a special role in becoming a center of resistance and sacrifices to check the onward march of British Forces to this part of India.  Therefore, in the history of Manipur and also our country as a whole, the Kangla Fort occupies a preeminent position reminding us of the fight of our people for independence.           The Kangla Fort is revered as the holiest place by Manipuris living in the State and outside.  Therefore, they consider it as a center of pilgrimage.  Woven into the history and mythology of the State, it casts a spell on the minds of its inhabitants and deeply influences them and their thinking.  In response to popular demand and popular feelings, the Government of India therefore decided to pass on the ownership of this majestic Fort to the State Government.  Just as Kangla Fort occupies the pride of place in the heart of Manipuri people, Manipur itself occupies a very special place in the hearts of all Indians.  Manipur is the sacred land where the fight launched by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose against our colonizing power, the British, reached the climax.  In fact, the first place on India soil where the National Flag was hoisted was MOIRANG in Manipur.  The farthest reach of the Indian National Army of Netaji was in Manipur and the stories of the battle for Imphal are stirring.  Many Indian patriots laid down their lives in search of freedom and glory in this land.  I am told that many people of Manipur were also involved in fighting as part of the INA.  This demonstrates that patriotism and love for our nation are deeply embedded in psyche of Manipuris just as in other parts of the country.           By deciding the transfer the ownership of the Kangla Fort to the people of Manipur, we salute their patriotism and love for our nation.           I must compliment the Government of Manipur on their plans to restore the glory of this Fort and make it a unique archaeological park in the entire north-eastern region.  It is heartening to note that the Kangla Development Project includes a scheme to plant indigenous trees and medicinal plants around the Fort.  While congratulating the people and the Government on this occasion and thanking them for their warm welcome and gracious hospitality to me and the members of my team, I must share my thoughts with you.           As you know Manipur and its culture and tradition has always fascinated people in the rest of India.  Our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Manipur in 1952 and in a letter to the Chief Minister referred to the State and its people in glowing terms and paid tribute to their artistry, culture, character and above all the women of the State whose freedom and independence left a mark on his mind.  He wrote "For Manipur to lose its distinctive character and culture would be a misfortune".  Keeping in mind the richness and diversity of the culture of this state, Pandit Nehru referred to Manipur as the Switzerland of the East and the  Jewel of India.           As I had told you earlier, it was Indira Gandhi who positively responded to the yearnings of the Manipuris to have a separate State so that they could fashion their destiny and develop and consonance with their own genius.  It is important and instructive to recall that Indira Gandhi while studying in Shantiniketan belonged to the Manipur Group and learnt Manipuri dance.  In fact during his visit to the State in 1952, Panditji saw a number of dances in Manipur and wrote, "The normal dances that we see elsewhere in India seem pale and insipid in comparison with this show at Manipur - The dancers were professionals and had many years of hard training.  But no amount of training can give that artistic touch and vitality which I found there, unless the people possess it".  This natural grace is what makes Manipur unique in all art forms and a cause of pride for all Indians.           In addition to its excellence in art forms, Manipur has been excelling in the recent past in the field of sports.  Many do not know that polo has been played here for centuries - much before the British Introduced it in the rest of India.  Manipur has been excelling in most sports ranging from football and hockey to weightlifting and archery.  Manipur sportspersons are household names across the country.  I hope that continues to produce world-class sportsmen and women who will bring glory to our nation.           Given the diversity of culture and traditions in Manipur and the strong bonds that like Manipuris with their fellow citizens, I believe that Manipur should benefit from the economic growth processes which are transforming our country.  We must rid our nation of want and disease and provide a decent, dignified, peaceful life to all citizens.  I commit our government to the rapid development of Manipur so that the people of Manipur live up to their full potential and enjoy the benefits of peace and prosperity.           Our government is committed to addressing the concerns and grievances of the people of Manipur.  I met representatives of some organizations of Manipur in Delhi.  I sympathized with the pain and sorrow of the mothers who had lost their children.  Having given my assurance that we will try to redress legitimate grievances on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, we have set up a committee to review the provisions of the Act.  The Committee will suggest checks and balances in the Act or replacing it with a more humane law which takes into account your legitimate aspirations and national security concerns.  It will complete its work in six months.  I hope the work of this committee will result in lasting peace and harmony.           The progress and development of Manipur will be advanced if peace and order prevails.  We must today resolve to eschew all violent methods of settling grievances and join the constitutional processes to find solutions.  As early as 1940, when a group of Manipuris met Mahatma Gandhi and informed him about the agitation they had launched against the discrimination imposed against them, Gandhiji advised them to keep agitation absolutely peaceful and non-violent.  When constitutional and other legal methods are available to redress our grievances it is not proper to resort to arms to register protests against the Government, which is willing to seek remedies to the problems of the people.  I appeal to all sections of Manipur society to come forward and engage themselves in the task of nation building so that jointly we can usher in an era of peace and prosperity for the people.           I have already said we want to improve Manipur's connectivity to the region around.  We would like to invest in the creation of modern infrastructure to enable this.  However, for this to happen, we need peace, security and political stability.  If we can work together to bring normalcy back I can assure you that Manipur will become Jewel of India.           Let the handing over of the Kangla Fort, the pride and glory of the State, open a new chapter in the history of Manipur, a chapter of understanding, amity, peace, justice and prosperity for all of us."
