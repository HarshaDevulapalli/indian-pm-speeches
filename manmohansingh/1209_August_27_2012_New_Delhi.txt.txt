Ladies and Gentlemen,
It has been my general practice not to respond to motivated criticism directed personally at me. My general attitude has been:
Hazaaron jawaabon se acchi hai meri khaamoshi
Na Jaane kitne sawaalon ki aabroo rakhi
But this is one occasion where I do want, and I ardently wish that I should be given the opportunity to speak to the Parliament, and also the public at large, and take them into confidence, but I am sorry that the House is not allowed to function, and that the BJP is determined to disrupt the normal functioning of Parliament.
I wish to assure the country that we have a very strong and credible case, the observations of the CAG are disputable, and they will be challenged when the matter comes before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee. So once again I appeal to the Opposition to come back to the House, to debate all these issues, and let the country judge where the truth lies.
