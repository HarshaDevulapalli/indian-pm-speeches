Mr. Speaker, Sir,        First of all, I express my sincere apologies for not being able to participate in this last session of the Fourteenth Lok Sabha on account of my medical treatment.  I am grateful for the good wishes extended to me by Madam President in her address at the commencement of this session.  For this kindness as well as the good wishes of all honourable Members, through you Sir, I thank them from the bottom of my heart.        We have in the last five years worked together to enhance our democratic process.  The legislations enacted in this Parliament in the last five years have redefined the role and rights of citizens.  This Parliament deepened the democratic process vesting in the citizen the right to call governance to account through the Act on Right to Information.  The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act that this Parliament enacted has vested the right to work to every rural household for hundred days of guaranteed employment.  The Unorganized Workers' Social Security Act, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act and The Central Educational Institutions (Right to Information) Act are only a few of the many path breaking, radical, social and economic legislations enacted by this Parliament that would refine the relationship between the state and its citizens for a long time to come.        This Parliament was unique in many other respects also.  The country faced some of its best times during the last five years, as it became the second fastest growing economy in the world.  It also witnessed some very challenging times when the global rise in oil prices led to a spiral of price rise in commodities, resulting in higher inflation which we brought under control through prudent economic policy.  Today we are addressing the global economic downturn with the same resolve and imagination.  Let me assure this House that India would emerge the least affected among the countries of the world from the current economic crisis.  Our foreign policy was steered in a manner that succeeded in ending our nuclear isolation and creates for us unprecedented global opportunities.Mr. Speaker, Sir,        In transacting business in this Parliament, you set yourself as a role model.  We strained your patience and at times, even your conscience.  There were unusual times in which you had to take a call between defending Parliamentary propriety and heeding to the demands of the organization that you had spent a lifetime building.  On all such occasions your sagacity prevailed.  I have no words to express the gratitude of this House for upholding the dignity of both your high office and the dignity of this institution in times of personal trial.  I express the sentiments of all the members of this House when I say that in Sri Somnath Chatterjee, the office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has been truly elevated and dignified.  History would be the best judge of your unique contribution.  You stood like a rock to defend our best Parliamentary traditions and in doing so have raised the bar for those to follow.Mr. Speaker, Sir,        I would be failing in my duty if I don't thank the Leader of the Opposition, Shri Advaniji in always being constructive as we collectively addressed national challenges in spite of occasional disagreements.  I express my gratitude to the leader of the United Progressive Alliance, Smt. Sonia Gandhi who has been inspiration for many of the progressive legislations we moved in this august House.  I also thank the leaders of the political parties represented in this House and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs for ensuring smooth conduct of business.        The Secretary General and staff of the Lok Sabha deserve our commendation for the exemplary way in which they managed the administrative affairs of this House.  On behalf of all of us, I thank them.        Let me take this opportunity to wish all the honorable members who will participate in the next round of Parliament elections, the very best in their efforts to continue to serve this institution.  We have sought to collectively contribute to this great institution of Parliamentary democracy that our nation has built and each one of us should remember this privilege and sacred duty to our nation with immense gratitude and humility.        Thank you, Sir.
