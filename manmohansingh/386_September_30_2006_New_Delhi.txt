I am visiting South Africa to participate in the Satyagraha Centenary Celebrations being organized by the Government of South Africa.  The philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi of resisting injustice and oppression by pursuing the path of truth and non-violence was born in South Africa and is a powerful legacy that is shared by the people of India and South Africa.  	I will also visit places which mark some milestones in the Mahatma's remarkable life; the Pietermaritzburg station where he was thrown out of an all white train compartment, Phoenix Settlement and the Constitution Hill prison where he was incarcerated.  I will also visit the Umbilo Park Memorial where several years later, brave South Africans opposed the injustice of the apartheid regime.	I also hope to have the opportunity to meet Dr. Nelson Mandela whose life and work bear Gandhiji's deep influence.	I will have the opportunity to review bilateral relations and the India-South Africa Strategic Partnership with President Mbeki.  I hope to discuss with President Mbeki measures that both countries can take to further deepen our partnership.	South Africa is India's biggest trading partner in the African continent.  Many Indian companies are expanding their business presence there.  Similarly, I think that there is much that South Africa can offer India.  I hope we will be able to identify steps to enhance our current commercial and economic relationship.	I will also take this opportunity to discuss with President Mbeki current international issues.  Our two countries share a common vision of a cooperative, rule-based multi-polar world order.  I think that South Africa and India have a major role to play in carrying forward the agenda for reforms at the UN, including the expansion of permanent membership of the UN Security Council, so that the interests of the developing world are better reflected and realized in this organization, and in newer initiatives such as IBSA.
