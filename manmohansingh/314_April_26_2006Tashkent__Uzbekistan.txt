"I am deeply honoured to be in your midst today for the inauguration of the India Uzbekistan Centre for Information Technology named after the great illustrious son of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who had the vision to lay the foundations of India's scientific and technological advancement. Investment in education and training is an investment in the future of a country. It is a tool for generation of employment and improvement in the quality of life of the people. Progress is linked to fully exploiting the opportunities created by the use of Information and Communication Technologies. India has made considerable strides in the sphere of Information Technology. The fruits of Information Technology are now being harvested in rural India as well. We are also working to take connectivity to the remotest corners of India. Modern technology has reduced the barriers of time and space and it enables countries to leapfrog stages of development. Countries therefore, must redouble efforts to bridge the knowledge gap, both within themselves and with advanced countries. It is only then that our youth and scientists can participate fully in the global market place of ideas, knowledge and information. I am confident that this Centre will train knowledge workers in Uzbekistan to enable them to compete with confidence in the global market place. Friends, it gives me great pleasure to join your Prime Minister Mirziyayev in inaugurating this Centre which symbolizes the modern and dynamic face of India- Uzbekistan friendship and cooperation."
