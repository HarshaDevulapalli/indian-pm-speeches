 "I extend my hearty congratulations to Shri Tej Ram Prajapati and Shri Jamal Ahmed Ansari, the distinguished winners of the Kabir Puraskar for the year 2003 and Dr. S.N. Subba Rao, founder of the National Youth Project Trust, the well known organisation, which is the distinguished awardee for the National Communal Harmony Award. The traditions of communal harmony and tolerance and respect for diversity have always been the redeeming features of our civilisation. The Kabir Puraskar and the National Communal Harmony Awards honour those individuals and organisations who not only follow these precious traditions, but are prepared to defend them even at the cost of their lives. The 'Kabir Puraskar', which has been recognised as a National Award since 1990, is aptly named. Nearly six hundred years ago, the saint Kabir blended the mystic aspects of the various religious traditions of our country, and provided to later generations a sense of what we would today call Unity in Diversity. Among his many luminous 'dohas', Kabir had urged each of us to find within ourselves the spark of goodness or genius to inspire everyone. He wrote:                                 'Jaisay til mein tel hai, jyon chakmak mein aag,                                 Tera saayin tujh mein hai, tu jaag sakay to jaag.'
