"I am indeed honoured to be here today to launch the Project for Information and Communication Technology Enablement of the Indian Judiciary. I am certain that this project will be a landmark in improving the administration of justice in our country. One of the greatest strengths of our nation has been the "rule of law" and the manner in which our judiciary has upheld this core principle.            Under the National Common Minimum Programme, this Government has pledged to give a fresh momentum to judicial reforms because it affects the quality of life of every citizen.  This programme aims at economic growth through equity and social justice. And justice is enshrined in our constitution with the judiciary upholding the lofty standards set by the founding fathers of our Republic.            It is the hallmark of our democracy that under the umbrella of the Indian Constitution, the legislative, executive and judicial wings of State have constantly engaged in providing a fair and unimpeachable framework for dispensing justice to all.  The goal of a mature and democratic government is to provide the common man a framework where the rule of law prevails and justice is dispensed without fear or favour.  The freedom of speech and action, freedom of religious practice, equality of opportunity and the citizen's duties emanating from such freedoms, is the bulwark of our society.  It is the function of our judiciary to protect these freedoms and ensure the discharge of duties by citizens within the ambit of existing laws and in the true spirit of our Constitution.  It is only then that the spirit of our citizens and confidence of society will be unleashed to embark upon bold enterprises, be it economic, intellectual or social. A stable, sound legal system which dispenses effective justice is an essential prerequisite for sustained economic growth as well.             We can hold our heads high that the judiciary of our country has been an example of probity and fairness.  The higher judiciary has constantly engaged in soul searching to improve and strengthen the judicial process and justice delivery systems to make it more accessible, cost effective and quick.  However, as in all systems, there is always room for improvement. A vibrant institution is ever eager to look at shortcomings in the face and turn a challenge into an opportunity.  One of the shortcomings that has been noticed in our judicial system is the delay in the disposal of cases in the courts.  This may partly be due to the high vacancy position at all levels of the judiciary. However, we must admit that there is a need to increase the speed of disposal of cases and reduce pendency. After all, justice delayed is justice denied. There is also lack of availability of information about the status of individual cases by litigants. Another feature of our legal system is the high cost that it imposes on those seeking legal redressal of their problems. High cost of dispensing and securing justice is an entry barrier for the poor. Equality in law becomes an unattainable ideal because high cost prevents easy access to courts. Equality in law, hence, requires equal access to law.  Technology offers solutions to some of our problems. Putting in place a modern and efficient justice delivery mechanism with the help of computerization and online systems spanning the entire judicial infrastructure is within the realms of possibility.  The E-Committee under the guidance of the Hon'ble Chief Justice has undertaken a laudable project to enhance judicial productivity - both qualitatively and quantitatively - as also to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost effective, transparent and accountable.  Though similar objectives have been achieved in other parts of the world by the use of technology, these benefits could not be fully exploited for the Indian judiciary so far.              The project envisaged by the E-Committee proposes to address this issue and I have full faith that within the time frame proposed by the Committee, the judiciary will be fully computerized.  The project on completion will help achieve our goals through effective use of IT in the administration of justice, litigation support, preparation of legal data bases, classification of cases and management of court proceedings.            I assure you that for such an important scheme that aims to streamline the judiciary, the Government will lend its full support, both managerial and financial.  I am advised by my colleague, the Law Minister, that the Government is taking steps to provide adequate funds for the proposed project of the E-Committee.At the same time, I would like to request the Honourable Judges and the Law Minister to think of ways in which securing justice becomes easier, faster and cheaper. A system which is simple, easy to understand, easy to access and inexpensive will go a long way in ensuring that the noble intentions behind many of our laws, which were designed to address the needs of large sections of our population, are genuinely fulfilled.  The Honourable Chief Justice has taken many steps to streamline judicial functioning and making the judicial system more accountable. The Government fully supports all these endeavours - whether it be fast track courts or use of IT - and hopes that there will be many more such initiatives in future.            Before concluding, I thank and commend Justice Lahoti for his vision, guidance and active support in this endeavour.  I also thank the Law Minister for piloting the scheme in the Central Government and lending his support for launching the project. I wish the project all success."
