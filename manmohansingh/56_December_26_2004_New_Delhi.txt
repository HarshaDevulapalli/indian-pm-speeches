 "Early this morning, I learnt with deep shock of the devastation caused by an earthquake in the Andaman seas, and the consequent tidal waves in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and our eastern coast. I have received reports of extensive loss of life, severe damage to public and private property and disruption of communications. I am deeply distressed by the large scale devastation that has been wrought. My heartfelt sympathies are with the families of the bereaved, and with all those affected in our country. I have spoken to the Chief Ministers of the affected States, to assure them of all possible Central support and assistance in the relief and rehabilitation effort. The Defence and Home Ministers have been asked to alert the armed forces and paramilitary forces, who are already assisting in providing relief to all those who have been affected in the disaster. The Cabinet Secretary has taken a meeting of the Crisis Management Group, and all Government departments are on alert to provide the maximum possible assistance. I have deputed two of my Cabinet colleagues, Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar, and Shri Dayanidhi Maran, to survey the affected areas and co-ordinate relief and rescue efforts. The Home Minister is also visiting the affected areas shortly. At this juncture, I would appeal to all citizens in the affected coastal districts to remain calm, and to assist wherever possible in the provision of relief. There is no cause whatsoever for alarm, as the situation is being monitored very closely. I have also sent messages of sympathy to the Presidents of Maldives, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, as well as the Prime Minister of Thailand, where reports of heavy damage are coming in. India also stands ready to assist these friendly nations, should our help be required".
