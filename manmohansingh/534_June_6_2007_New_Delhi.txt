I am visiting Germany to attend the Summit Meeting of G8 and Outreach Countries (Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa) being organised at Heiligendamm by the German G8 Presidency on June 8.	At the summit, I will have the opportunity to present India's viewpoint on the global issues that have been identified by the G8 for special focus including climate protection, energy efficiency, and the conclusion of the Doha round of talks. Our viewpoint, and the viewpoint of much of the developing world on these issues, is that while addressing them due care must be taken not to allow growth and development prospects in the developing world to be undermined or constrained. At the summit, I will speak on issues related to climate change. I will emphasize the need not to lose sight of the fundamental and universally accepted principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities between the developed and developing worlds. It is also a fact that more and not less development is the best way for developing countries to address themselves to the issue of preserving the environment and protecting the climate. Prior to the meeting with leaders of the G8, the President of Mexico will host a meeting of leaders of the Outreach countries in Berlin on June 7, where we will discuss our positions on global issues that are of special relevance to the developing world. On the sidelines of both these Summit Meetings, I will also have the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with some of the leaders present, including Chancellor Merkel of Germany who is our host, other leaders of the G-8, and the leaders of China, Mexico, Nigeria as also the Secretary General of the United Nations.  	I look forward to my visit to Germany, and I would like to thank Chancellor Merkel for her gracious invitation for India to join in an exchange of views with the G8 countries.
