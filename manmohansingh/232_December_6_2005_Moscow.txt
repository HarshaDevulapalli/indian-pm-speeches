"Thank you for your warm welcome and words of sincere friendship.  My wife and I are truly honoured and happy to be here. It is a privilege to experience the warm hospitality and affection of the most generous First Couple of Russia.  To be among cherished friends is always heartwarming. Mr. President, I fully reciprocate the warm sentiments that you have expressed today.  We in India value your friendship and regard.              Fifty years ago, our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited this great city and laid the foundation of an abiding friendship - a friendship based on mutual trust and confidence. Today on that foundation stands an impressive edifice. Today we share an even stronger bond. We admire your far-sighted and committed leadership in reinforcing this structure and thank you for the personal attention you have devoted to the rejuvenation and deepening of this relationship.  I am convinced that we will find even greater convergence in our efforts as we move forward. I have no hesitation in saying that communication between our two great nations has never been so clear and lively.               It is fitting to recall the crucial assistance we received from Russia in India's emergence as a country with a fully developed industrial base. There is no significant sector of our national endeavour in which we have not benefited from Russia.                            Today as before, Russia is a valued strategic partner.  Our relationship has adapted very successfully and productively to current requirements.    But what we will do together in partnership draws on the legacy of cooperating for mutual benefit. Our strategic relationship is based on political consensus in both countries. Despite the historic transformations underway in both countries, the essence of our partnership has not been diluted. The number of sectors of our cooperation has expanded and the terms of our interaction have evolved. The friendship our people bear for the Russian people endures.              We draw strength from the multi-cultural, and diverse character of our respective societies. These values and ideals allow us to understand each other's concerns and aspirations and encourage us to work together in multilateral forums in pursuit of common objectives. We are united in our support for a multi-polar world, and in our resolve to root out the menace of international terrorism.            Our economic prosperity and mutual interest lie in closer partnership in trade, investment, joint research and development, in taking full advantage of the opportunities available in an increasingly inter-connected and globalized world. Energy security is a priority area for future cooperation, as are the frontier areas of science.              I am confident our cooperation in the coming year will be another significant landmark in the history of our bilateral relations, taking our traditional friendship to greater heights.  I request you to join me in a toast to:- the health and well-being of Their Excellencies the President and First  Lady of the Russian Federation;- the further strengthening of the multi faceted cooperation between   India and Russia; and- everlasting friendship between our two countries and peoples."
