Mr. Chairman, Sir, I join the Leader of Opposition and all other colleagues who have spoken on this very sensitive issue and I congratulate the hon. Members that they have spoken with great restraint. The North-Eastern Region of our country is a very sensitive region, but one thing that I would like to say that whatever may have happened in Kokrajhar and other areas should not be used as an occasion to fan rumours to create an environment in other parts of our country that the people from the North-East feel insecure. What is at stake is the unity and integrity of our country; what is at stake is communal harmony; and, it is the solemn obligation of all of us, regardless of the party that we may belong to, to work together to create an atmosphere when this rumour mongering will come to an end, that the people of the North-Eastern States feel genuinely that any part of our country welcomes them.  If there are any miscreants, if there are people who are fanning these rumours, I think they should be brought to book.  I have been in touch with the Chief Ministers of various States and I assure you, Sir, that we will do our utmost of ensure that our friends, our children and our citizens from the North-East feel secure in any part and every part of our country.  This country belongs to them as to any one of us, and, therefore, as patriots, we must send out a message to all those who want to disturb peace and amity among various regions, among various communities that this House stands unitedly in support of all the people of the North East.  That we will work together to give them a feeling of security, that we will work together to curb and effectively control all the elements who are out to create trouble on this very sensitive issue.
