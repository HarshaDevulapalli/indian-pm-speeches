Thousands of people have died in this disaster caused by a tsunami wave triggered by an earthquake. We have all seen pictures of agony, pain, trauma and of the dislocation of life and loss of property. We have also been witness to the tragedy in our neighbouring  countries including the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand.The government will do whatever is required and expected of it to provide relief and assist in rehabilitation. I am sure each one of us will voluntarily extend help and support to the best of our ability. It is at times like these that the best in us comes out and the human spirit transcends all adversity.
