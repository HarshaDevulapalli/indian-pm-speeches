"It is a pleasure for me to participate in the 70th Anniversary celebrations of the All India Football Federation and on this occasion to inaugurate the 11th National Football League. We have a long tradition of playing football in India and in the past, we have done well in the Olympic and Asian Games. However, in recent years, a need has been felt to professionalise this important sport in India. In this connection, I am very happy that private sponsors have come forward to support the game and that the winner of the National Football League will be presented with the ONGC Cup. It is a positive trend that public interest and sponsorship are growing in sports other than cricket. I understand that the FIFA President, Mr. Blatter, has proposed the idea of a special plan for India to raise its standard in the game. We should pool all our resources in this direction. I was in Brazil last year and I did raise the subject of cooperation between India and Brazil in the field of Soccer. I do hope that the Federations of both countries are following on this important matter. I wish to commend both Zee Sports and the ONGC for their support for the development of football in India. On the occasion of the 70th Anniversary of the All India Football Federation, I declare the 11th National Football League and ONGC Cup open."
